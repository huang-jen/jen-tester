Secondly: using a range of products specifically for hair shedding/loss and for repairing and elasticising hair - @curlsmith Full lengths density elixir and Scalp stimulating booster on a daily basis aswell as @rootsdoubleeffect Hair loss intensive spray, the Curlsmith Bond curl rehab salve weekly, and the @olaplex No.3 Hair perfector and @philip_kingsley elasticizer every other week.

If you\u2019re just beginning your skincare journey, we have some friendly advice for you. Remember, it\u2019s all about finding the correct balance and giving your skin the tender loving care it deserves. Here are some common mistakes to avoid:\n\n1. Stick to Your Products: It\u2019s tempting to try something new every week, but your skin needs consistency. Changing products too often can confuse your skin and make it hard to see real results.\n\n2. High Percentage \u2260 Instant Success: Don\u2019t be swayed by high percentages of active ingredients. More isn\u2019t always better. Gradually increasing the concentration is the key to achieving the best results.\n\n3. Introduce Slowly: When you get excited about new products, it\u2019s easy to pile them all on at once. However, this can overwhelm your skin. Gradually introduce new products, giving your skin time to adapt.\n\n4. Gentle with Retinol: Retinol is a superstar, but don\u2019t use it every night. 2-3 times a week is plenty to get those anti-aging benefits without overdoing it.\n\n5. No Overreacting: When your skin acts up, resist the urge to throw the kitchen sink at it. Focus on repairing your skin\u2019s natural barrier, as a healthy barrier is key to happy skin.\n\n6. One at a Time: Incorporate only one new product at a time. This way, you can track its effects and figure out whether it\u2019s a game-changer for your skin.\n\nRemember, skincare is a journey, not a race. Take it one step at a time, and your skin will thank you in the long run! \ud83c\udf3c\u2728   \n\n           "], ["hashtags: ", ["#SkincareTips", "#HealthySkin", "#SkincareJourney", "#SkincareSimplicity", "#GentleGlow", "#SkinLoveJourney", "#HealthyHabitsFirst", "#GlowingSkin", "#BeautyRoutine", "#SkinCare101", "#ClearSkin", "#SkinCareSecrets", "#SelfCareSundays", "#RadiantComplexion", "#NurturedSkin"]]], "https://www.instagram.com/p/CzRBWVxtiIJ/": [["likes: ", "likes are hidden"], ["comments: ", "comments are hidden"], ["caption: ", "Use Retinoids If you want to:\n\n\u2705 Increase collagen\n\u2705 Treat acne\n\u2705 Reduce fine lines and wrinkles\n\u2705 Brighten dull skin\n\u2705 Improve texture\n\u2705 Regulate oily skin\n\u2705 Decrease hyperpigmentation \n\n           "], ["hashtags: ", ["#GlowWithRetinoids", "#SkinSaverSecrets", "#RadianceRevival", "#TextureTransformation", "#SkinCareEssentials", "#AntiAgingMagic", "#AcneSolutions", "#HealthySkinJourney", "#FlawlessSkinGoals", "#BeautyRituals", "#ClearSkinConfidence", "#YouthfulGlow"]]], "https://www.instagram.com/p/CzgiJZct0xD/": [["likes: ", "likes are hidden"], ["comments: ", "comments are hidden"], ["caption: ", "Let me break it down for you in simpler terms and share some tips on choosing the right acid for your skin type.\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 PHA (Poly Hydroxy Acid) is great for sensitive skin.\n\u2705 It gently exfoliates the top layer of your skin while keeping your skin\u2019s moisture intact.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 AHA (Alpha Hydroxy Acid) for Dry Skin.\n\u2705 AHA helps remove dead skin cells on the surface, leaving your skin feeling smoother and more hydrated.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 BHA (Beta Hydroxy Acid) is your go-to if you have oily skin.\n\u2705 It works deep within your pores to tackle excess sebum and clear out oils and debris.\n\n           "], ["hashtags: ", ["#SkincareEssentials", "#HealthySkin", "#BeautyTips", "#SkinRoutine", "#GentleExfoliation", "#SkinCare101", "#ClearSkin", "#SkinLove", "#SkinCareDemystified", "#PHAVersusAHA", "#BHAExplained", "#SkinTypeMatters"]]], "https://www.instagram.com/p/CzWO9rIN2H_/": [["likes: ", "likes are hidden"], ["comments: ", "comments are hidden"], ["caption: ", "Effective skincare routines require careful timing and layering of products to maximize their benefits.

sales I thought I would treat myself to some new make up. \n\nI have had so many people tell me I need to try the @lorealpro True March Foundation but my mistake I picked up the serum but I still love it! They currently have a deal on which was spend a certain amount , I want to say \u00a312 and get a free mascara. I am also in love with the Volume Million Lashes Mascara, my lashes look incredible! \n\nI have been saving up my points and it was about time to I spent them. I have seen so many people with @lancomeofficial All Over Concealer & I\u2019ve wanted it for so long! So now it\u2019s mine!!
